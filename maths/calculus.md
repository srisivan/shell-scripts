# What **is** calculus?

Calculus is the mathematics of **change.** It **relates** two completely
different things in the world around us. We do this by many concepts present
here. They are : _Functions, limits, derivatives, limits and integrals._

The first thing we will be studying is _functions._ 

# Functions? What are Functions?

This is the first question we all ask when studying about functions. What
**are** they? It is a lot like asking what a number is. We don't know a number
is, but we know it when we see it. 

Example : When we see 3 apples, we know that it represents a quantity. 

We know more of what a number does than what it is. It is the same with
functions. We know what a function _does,_ than what it _is._ So here it is :

_A functions assigns each number in its **domain**, another number._
This statement doesn't explain much at beginning.
A more familiar statement is ;

_A function is thought of as a set of rules which the numbers **plugged** into it
follow._

 
The term _plugged_ refers to the numbers put in a function.

Example :
```
	f(2) = 4 - this function assigns the number 2 to 4.
	f(3) = 9 - this function assigns the number 3 to 9.
	f(4) = 16 - this function assigns the number 4 to 16
	f(5) = 25 - this function assigns the number 5 to 25.

```
follow the rule,
```
	f(x) = x * x
```

The _domain_ consists of all the numbers for which the rule makes sense.

For example : for the function,
```
	f(x) = 1 / x
```

This function does not always make sense. Because we are **dividing** by x, x
must follow some rules.

To divide by x, x must _not be equal to 0._ ( Dividing by 0 is forbidden.)
All the other numbers are suitable for this purpose.

So we can say the **domain** of this function is all real numbers, not equal
to zero. 

We write domains as _intervals_ of numbers, assuming a < b,

(a,b) is the _open_ interval between them, _excluding_ a and b.

[a,b] is the _closed_ interval between them, _including_ a and b.

[c, inf) is all the numbers between c and infinity, including c.

(c, inf) is all the numbers between c and infinity, excluding c.

(-inf, d)
