title : The Joy of writing Blogs.

I like to write blogs beacause, it is fun doing so. Blogs can be thought of a
_recollection_ of thoughts, ideas and memories present in your mind. It can be
thought as writing them in a diary. Blogs help you to _remember_ these. I
started to write blogs a few months ago. I found it interesting. 

The steps are as follows :

1. Writing in the text editor(which is _vim_ in my mac), 
2. Converting it to a text file using the _pandoc_ program, 
3. Editing it in the _TextWrangler_,
4. And then finally publishing it in the medium website.

I especially found the steps to go through to publish, interesting.
I then take the link of the website and share it within my family and friends,
so that they can know my thoughts and experiences. This idea of _writing
**this** blog_ struck to me before, and so I have started writing it. 

I have published some blogs earlier and hope to publish more hereafter.
