title: 'The Joy of writing Blogs.'

I like to write blogs because, it is fun doing so. Blogs can be thought
of a *recollection* of thoughts, ideas and memories present in your
mind. It can be thought as writing them in a diary. Blogs help you to
*remember* these. I started to write blogs a few months ago. I found it
interesting.

The steps are as follows :

1.  Writing in the text editor(which is _vim_ in my mac),
2.  Converting it to a text file using the _pandoc_ program,
3.  Editing it in the *TextWrangler*,
4.  And then finally publishing it in the medium website.

I especially found the steps to go through to publish, interesting. I
then take the link of the website and share it within my family and
friends, so that they can know my thoughts and experiences. This idea of
*writing **this** blog* struck to me before, and so I have started
writing it.

I have published some blogs earlier and hope to publish more hereafter.
