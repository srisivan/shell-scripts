It was finally over. It was the last day. It was the last exam.
Everybody were happy even before writing it. Everybody were fooling each
other, for it was April Fools Day. For example,

Ramesh : *Hey, Do you know, 8th lesson is also there for exam!*

Suresh : *Huh? Who told so?*

Ramesh : *Computer ma'am came here and informed on the last day!*

Suresh : *Oh My God! I didn't even take care about that lesson!(looking
very tensed.)*

Ramesh : *Ha! ha! ha! April Fool, April Fool!*

Suresh : *Oh!*

Even I fooled my friends!

The computer exam passed on without much tension. Most of the students
finished the paper 1 hour before time.

Mam collected the papers quickly.At the word from mam, saying
*"Children, go collect your bags quickly, without noise,"* everybody
rushed out of the exam hall to take their bags. Among them, I heard one
boy saying *"Exam's are over! No more tension! No more reading! Hey,
Hey!"* Everybody packed their bags quickly and stood in a line out of
the exam hall.

When the bell finally rang, everybody ran out of the classes and out of
the school.

Some went to their respective classes to meet their friendsand others to
their class teachers. I thought that I should go to my best friends. But
due to thr rush and hurry bury, I came right out of my school to my van.
Everybody were happy.

When I reached home, I commanded my mother saying, *"If you try to tell
me to read from tommorow... I will never do it!"*
