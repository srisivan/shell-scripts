This was the first time I went to Tirupati, the temple town.  

It was 2:30 am, my mother woke me with a cup of coffee. After that we got ready for the
journey in the next two hours. Meanwhile, our grandparents were ready 
before us. My grandfather is well known in the family for his briskness especially to go on a trip like this.  
My mother and grandmother had prepared lunch and breakfast. It was upma for
breakfast and puliogare for lunch.

We left for the bus stand in about 4:45 am, with my father, who dropped us.
The streets were deserted except for some people and cycles roaming on the
road. Stray dogs were howling here and there. But when we reached the
mainroad, there were some trucks and busses moving and honking around.

The bus arrived after 10 minutes, at 4:55.
We boarded the bus by five. I and my sister found our seats in the front
quickly. My mother and grandparents were back of us. 

A lady draped in yellow coloured sari and a little aged, urged my mother move front quickly. Even though
my mother kept on moving and there was no rush, she was pushing hardly against my mother. My mother
could feel some  movment in her handbag. She finally lost her patience and screamed at the lady to go first. The lady left
my mother the way and got down the bus and ran away, which was surprising. My mother settled and
checked her bag. She was right. _The lady had tried to steal stuff from her
bag! Thank goodness, my mother's glasses had protected her things._ In a later
we realized that pack of chocalates were gone.

We were lucky enough to find a seats in the front itself. The bus started in about five minutes.
In the first one hour I was awake in the bus. I looking out of the window, the world was dark blue colour. 
The trees, plants and buildings made dark patches in the dark blue sky. The air was gushing through the windows.
The feelings was so nice. After enjoying this for a while, eventually I fell asleep.

The bus stopped at main stops, like _Mulbagal, Chittor, Kolar, Palmaner._ I
had slept nicely till the bus stopped for a break at Mulbagal. We had our
brakfast there. I did not sleep thereafter.

The sun was a perfect circle and orange in colour. The road was
surrounded with trees and plants on both sides. It was filled with curves and
turns. Now the sky was light blue. 

I was sitting with my grandfather. He was adivising me to observe everything on the road, especially the green boards
with distances for destinations on it. 

We reached at _Tirupati_ at about 10:30. The first place we visited was _Tiruchanur_ the
place where the temple of Lakshmi,  _Sri Venkateshvara Swamy's wife,_ exists. The temple
is named as _Alamelu Mangapuram._ 

The temple had strict rules. For example, you had to leave your electronic
devices and footwares outside the temple.
