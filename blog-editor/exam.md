It was finally over. It was the last day. It was the last exam. 
Everybody were happy even before writing it. 
Everybody were fooling each other, for it was April Fools Day. For example,

Ramesh : _Hey, Do you know, 8th lesson is also there for exam!_

Suresh : _Huh? Who told so?_

Ramesh : _Computer ma'am came here and informed on the last day!_

Suresh : _Oh My God! I didn't even take care about that lesson!(looking very tensed.)_

Ramesh : _Ha! ha! ha! April Fool, April Fool!_

Suresh : _Oh!_

Even I fooled my friends!

The computer exam passed on without much tension. 
Most of the students finished the paper 1 hour before time. 

Mam collected the papers quickly.At the word from mam, saying _"Children, go collect your bags quickly, without
noise,"_ everybody rushed out of the exam hall to take their bags. 
Among them, I heard one boy saying _"Exam's are over! No more tension! No more reading!
Hey, Hey!"_ Everybody packed their bags quickly and stood in a line out of the
exam hall. 

When the bell finally rang, everybody ran out of the classes and
out of the school. 

Some went to their respective classes to meet their friendsand others to their class teachers. 
I thought that I should go to my best friends. 
But due to thr rush and hurry bury, I came right out of my school to my van. 
Everybody were happy. 

When I reached home, I commanded my mother
saying, _"If you try to tell me to read from tommorow... I will never do it!"_
